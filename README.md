# pypodcaster

Simple Podcast Publishing

`pypodcaster` is meant to be one of the simplest podcast publishers available. It generates a standard RSS feed based on the ID3 tags of media files in a given directory. Podcast media can be served from a public-facing HTML server or hosted from the Public folder in Dropbox.

## Install

    sudo python setup.py install

## Setup

Create a directory to hold your podcast media on a public-facing html server or Dropbox Public folder (e.g. `~/Dropbox/Public`).

    mkdir podcast

Enter channel information into `channel.yml`

Note: `title`, `link`, and `description` are required fields. The rest are optional.

```
title: 'Podcast Title'
link: 'http://link-to-website-corresponding-to-the-channel.com'
description: 'Phrase or sentence describing the channel.'
language: 'en-us'
copyright: 'Copyright notice for channel content.'
subtitle: 'Podcast Subtitle'
podcast_url: 'https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12345678/podcast/'
image: 'cover.jpg' # full url or image under podcast_url
author: 'Author name or Company'
owner:
  name: 'John Doe'
  email: 'john@doe.com'
categories: ['Religion & Spirituality', 'Christianity']
explicit: No
keywords: [comma, separated, list]
```

## Usage

`cd` to directory containing podcast media and run

    pypodcaster > podcast.xml

`pypodcaster` will create `podcast.xml` with settings from `channel.yml`. Run the command every time you wish to update the podcast feed.

## Advanced

### Episodic Images

Episodic images are supported by placing a jpg image with the same filename, title tag, or album name alongside the mp3 file.

If album name is used, an image can carry across an entire series without the need to have one image per mp3 episode. If no jpg is provided, the episode defaults to the channel's cover image.

#### Example

```
Contents of Dropbox/Public/podcast:
  First Podcast.mp3
  First Podcast.jpg # lower case "first podcast.jpg" would also work
  series01.mp3
  series02.mp3
  series03.mp3
  Series Name.jpg # from id3's album tag. 
```
